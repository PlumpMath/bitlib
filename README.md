# bitlib
A collection of useful JS utils. Mostly math and graphics related.

I just made this for myself - a collection of functions that I find useful and make experimental / creative coding easier. Not something you'd necessarily want to include wholesale in production code. Feel free to use it however you want though. This will grow and change over time.
